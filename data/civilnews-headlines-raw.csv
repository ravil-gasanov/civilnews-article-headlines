However, on other issues, less progress was made,” ,noted, Christian Danielsson in the early minutes of March 19, after a 10-hour-long meeting with the ruling Georgian Dream party and opposition leaders.,Danielsson, European Council President Charles Michel’s ,special envoy, to ,mediate, Georgia crisis talks, said he will now leave for Brussels on March 19 morning to report the state of progress to President Michel.,“Ultimately, the responsibility to find solution to this political crisis is that of Georgia’s political leaders. This is essential for the country’s democratic consolidation and its European aspirations,” underscored Mr. Danielsson.,Akaki Minashvili of the United National Movement, the largest opposition party, ,said, “the Georgian Dream once again closed the door to Europe,” noting that the ruling party rejected the release of alleged political prisoners and the snap elections, two of the opposition’s key demands.,“The West has seen once again, who it deals with [the Georgian Dream],” ,said, Giorgi Vashadze, leader of opposition Strategy Aghmashenebeli after the round of talks. “The opposition was inclined to reaching the deal and acted with a constructive attitude, but the attitude the Georgian Dream has shown could not lead to the agreement,” he said.,Khatuna Samnidze, leader of the Republican Party, part of the United National Movement-led electoral bloc, also ,blamed, the ruling party for yet another fruitless round of talks, noting that the Georgian Dream is not ready to bear its share of responsibility.,On his part, Irakli Kobakhidze, the Georgian Dream chairperson, ,said, w,recking the talks was the opposition’s end goal in itself.  He ,accused the opposition of talking the language of “ultimatums” contradicting the rule of law – referring to the release of alleged political prisoners.,“When facing anti-state ultimatums, naturally, politicians in charge of the country need to give [proper] responses to these ultimatums. Of course, we acted this way” and rejected these demands of snap elections and alleged political prisoners, he stated.,MP Kobakhidze then slammed “most of” the negotiating opposition leaders for being “directed from Kyiv by Mikheil Saakashvili.”,Another GD negotiator, Parliament Speaker Archil Talakvadze ,said, the ruling party was ready to reach a deal at the lengthy round but the opposition prioritized issues that are in the interests of “several of their parties,” instead of the country and its people.,European Council President Charles Michel’s special envoy Christian Danielsson arrived in Tbilisi on March 12 for a three-day visit but decided to extend his trip late on March 14, as “some more time” was needed for the sides to reach a consensus.,President Michel initiated the mediation to resolve the deadlock after the ,detention of opposition leader Nika Melia, only a few hours after PM Garibashvili’s ,approval, as Prime Minister. But the crisis began in November 2020 as the major opposition parties continue ,refusal, to enter the new Parliament, citing “fraudulent” October 2020 general elections.,Also Read:"

Nevertheless, pervasive allegations of pressure on voters and blurring of the line between the ruling party and the state reduced public confidence in some aspects of the process.”,“We call on all parties to address these deficiencies in advance of the second round and in future elections,” highlighted the U.S. Embassy.,It then called upon “Georgia’s citizens to be patient and allow the process to be conducted in a calm, peaceful, and respectful manner in accordance with Georgian law and international standards and practices.”,The Embassy called on the next parliament “to enact additional reforms to address the shortcomings spelled out by ODIHR in its election assessments.”"

TI Georgia believes this “creates tense atmosphere.”,ISFED, which observes 800 polling stations across the country, ,echoed, the assessments in its preliminary findings, saying the voting proceeds without major violations, but with several procedural violations documented at some polling stations.,The watchdog stressed “mobilization” of party activists and coordinators outside polling stations “raises particular concern.” It said the party representatives meet the voters as they enter the stations and record them in lists; in some cases, they also try to influence the voters, according to ISFED.,“This amounts to pressure on voters and control of their will, which endangers free expression of voters’ choice,” ISFED also noted, calling on the political parties and presidential candidates “exercising this practice,” to “immediately stop influencing the voters’ will.”,TI said it had filed four complaints about the voting process as of 1pm. ISFED said it had lodged 30 complaints as of 11am."

18/07/2001 - 16:26,The Government Cannot Control the State, Population Is Replacing the Government,5,"‘It may be said without any exaggeration that war is about to explode not only in Kakheti (eastern part of Georgia) and the Pankisi Valley (region in Kakheti) but also in the whole country. Russia has reached its aim as a result of the feebleness of Georgian government. Just a little more and conflict between Georgians and Chechens will last forever’, says ‘the Dilis Gazeti’ and it is worried about the situation existing in the valley. Many supporters of Luca Ramazashvili, leader of the public detached force, created in order to defend the population from kidnappers and drug abusers in Kakheti, have appeared recently.  The Georgian press supposes that in case a singe bullet is shot the situation will become uncontrollable.,Even though the process of exchanging hostages was initiated yesterday the armed population is not going to let its positions until criminals are not punished. Two Georgians and one Kist were released as a result of negotiations yesterday. Mamuka Arabuli, one of the released Georgians, said that he was kept in the family of Vepkhia Margoshvili’s, a very influential criminal authority in the Pankisi Valley, brother. Relying on the fact, Elene Tevdorandze, head of the human rights defense committee, stated that Vepkhia Margoshvili should be announced as a suspect accused of kidnapping and a crime case should be initiated against him.,Like other Georgian newspapers, ‘The Resonance’ makes negative comment on the Interior Ministry and Kakha Targamadze, the Minister: ‘Vepkhia Margoshvili has been under criminal search since 1992 but authorities of the Interior Ministry have never thought of the fact’.,‘There is a doubt that the police have not arrested Margoshvili because of definite interests and have been even defending him because he has been aware of certain information, which is not supposed to leak. Secret information is probably about drug business existing between criminals and law enforcement bodies’, Elene Tevdoradze told ‘the Resonance’.,Mamuka Areshidze, expert in Caucasian affairs, told ‘the Akhali Taoba’ that people on high positions are also evolved in drug dealing for it is a quite profitable business. He has once seen how an automobile gave drugs to shops in Akhmeta (town in Kakheti) and the police did nothing about it.,Mikheil Saakashvili, the Justice Minister, also accused the Interior Ministry in having deals with criminals and announced that when the government negotiates with a bandit (criminals in the Pankisi Valley are meant here) the state does not have a feeling of dignity.,The population of Kakheti, raised against injustice, demands that drug dealers be isolated, jurisdiction of Georgia be reestablished, and kidnapping be suppressed in the Pankisi Valley. ‘It is hard to imagine that criminals living in the valley will easily agree on the ultimatums… Kists know that Georgians will do everything in order to avoid bloody war. Besides, neither official structures of Georgia are happy about the public detached force led by Luca Ramazashvili’, ‘the Dilis Gazeti’ states. The following fact admits the opinion of the newspaper: Kakha Targamadze, the Interior Minister, attended the negotiations held between Georgians and Kists yesterday and requested that Chechen and Kist hostages be released without any term. The request was similar to that of the Kist criminals. Targamadze said that he could regulate the situation existing in the valley on his own and that he did not need local population’s assistance. The Georgian press considers that the Interior Ministry should have taken care of the valley earlier. Luca Ramazashvili did not compromise; he did not leave the valley up to the Interior Ministry again.,‘The public detached force will not be dismissed until order is reestablished in the Pankisi Valley.

Most of them were released on July 9; however three of them, including the chief of the unit Mikheil Surmava, remain in detention in the breakaway South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali.,Georgian State Minister for Conflict Resolutions Goga Khaindrava, who participated in an impromptu meeting of the Joint Control Comission in Tskhinvali on July 11, said that the South Ossetian side are offering to exchange the release of the three Georgians for the return of the unguided missiles that the Georgian side seized in breakaway region on July 7.,?They want missiles in exchange for three Georgian soldiers. But we do not exchange our soldiers for missiles,? Goga Khaindrava told reporters after the talks.,On July 7 Georgian troops confiscated two trucks, driven by Russian peacekeepers and loaded with some 300 unguided missiles. Moscow insists that the missiles were intended for the Russian peacekeeping troops deployed in the conflict zone and demands the return of the confiscated arms."

17/11/2019 - 18:41,Two Rallies Demand Snap Elections in Tbilisi, Parliament Blocked by Protesters,481,"Two parallel rallies are underway in downtown Tbilisi today, both demanding fully proportional snap elections. The protest led by united opposition and civic activists outside the parliament building commenced on 3pm, while another rally with similar demands, led by Alliance of Patriots began on 5pm on the First Republic Square, few hundred meters away.,The protesters at the rally -“Everyone minus one! Bidzina [Ivanishvili] must go!” – outside the parliament are protesting the ruling Georgian Dream party’s failure to pass promised constitutional amendment that would switch Georgia to fully proportional electoral system from 2020, instead of 2024.,The protesters outside the parliament voiced their key demands:,Grigol Vashadze of the National Movement said that the “all minus one” principle means not “all opposition parties minus Georgian Dream,” but “all citizens minus Georgian Dream.”,“We will not go home, but instead we will launch blocking the Parliament, because this legislature has lost its legitimacy. When the country’s informal ruler tells us that he does not care about us, we should use all radical tools envisaged by the constitution and laws to return Georgia to its citizens,” Vashadze said.,Gigi Ugulava of European Georgia, ex-Mayor of Tbilisi, noted that each day of the Georgian Dream remaining in power is dangerous for the country. “Ivanishvili is equal to chaos, chaos is equal to poverty and poverty is equal to our suffering,” he said, adding that the today’s day would be “crucial” and the Georgian Dream lawmakers remaining in the majority would not be able to continue their work in the Parliament building.,Mamuka Khazaradze, founder of the movement Lelo, also addressed the protesters, saying that Bidzina Ivanishvili deceived the entire country and “deprived us of the right to a free choice.”, “Together with my huge team, I will stand beside you. Our protest will be strong, in frames of law. I call on other parties to coordinate all steps with us, as well as with other parties and to avoid surprises. Our protest should be powerful,” he said.,Another rally, organized by the Alliance of Patriots party, gathered on the First Republic Square. Like the demonstration outside the parliament, protesters at First Republic Square also demand snap elections with fully proportional system. Alliance of Patriots and its supporters marched to Tbilisi State Opera, near Parliament building. Kremlin-friendly hate groups announced yesterday they would join the rally led by Alliance of Patriots.,Addressing the protesters, Irma Inashvili, leader of the Alliance of Patriots party, noted that the rally aims at changing the electoral system in the country and that their protests will be permanent in order to avoid “power usurpation.” She also said that Georgian Dream is creating political crisis in the country that prompted people to hit the streets.,Inashvili stressed that the Alliance of Patriots is acting independently and that they have their own “tactics and strategy.” “The more rallies are held on free, democratic elections, the better… Georgian Dream is wrong, when it assures itself that Georgian people are not interested in elections. We will continue the rallies throughout the country,” she addressed protesters.,Another leader of the Alliance of Patriots party, Davit Tarkhan-Mouravi said that their slogan remains unchanged “neither Georgian Dream, nor Saakashvili-Bokeria.” “This country belongs to the Georgian people. We should become owners of this country,” he addressed protesters.,The Georgian police has been mobilized since early morning. According to media reports, the policemen were stationed in the parliament courtyard, near the Georgian Dream party headquarters in old Tbilisi’s Erekle II square, as well as outside the ruling party chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili’s business-centre. Special Tasks Department of the Ministry of Interior is also mobilized, media reported.,Ministry of Interior released ,special statement ,earlier today, noting that “police forces are mobilized on one hand in order to protect the rights of expression and safety of citizens during assembly and manifestation and on the other hand to ensure uninterrupted functioning of state institutions.”,It also called on “every
citizen, organizers of the demonstration as well as participants to protect
order and obey legal requests of Police.”  “Any fact of Offense, as well as any attempt
of storming or blocking of administrative buildings during the demonstration wiIl
be immediately stopped by the Police,” statement reads."
