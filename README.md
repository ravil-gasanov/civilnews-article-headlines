# Article Headline modelling
I have scraped article data from civil.ge to:
(1) predict views from headlines (e.g. using Word2Vec embeddings + a recurrent NN)
(2) model headline topics (e.g. using Bayesian SMM) and use the inferred topics and the number of views to characterize articles that seem to gain most reads/clicks.

Assuming that civil.ge readership is representative of Georgian population is a stretch, but this can be a starting point for inspiration.
