# headline-topics-modelling
I have scraped article data from civil.ge to (1) model topics using LDA and (2) use the inferred topics and the number of views to characterize articles that seem to gain most reads/clicks.

Assuming that civil.ge readership is representative of Georgian population is a stretch, but this can be a starting point for inspiration.
